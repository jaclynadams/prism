# Spotify API Challenge

This project uses the AngularJS seed project as its foundation. [http://git-scm.com/](http://git-scm.com/).

## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the angular-seed repository and install the dependencies:

### Prerequisites

You must have node.js and npm installed.  You can get them from [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/).

### Install Dependencies

* We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [node package manager][npm].
* We get the angular code via `bower`, a [client-side code package manager][bower].

We have preconfigured `npm` to automatically run `bower` so we can simply do:

```
npm install
```

Behind the scenes this will also call `bower install`.  You should find that you have two new
folders in your project.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need
* `app/bower_components` - contains the angular framework files


### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server.  The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:8000/app/index.html`.
